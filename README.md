# fraud_detection

This repo is a work on the card fraud dataset available on https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
The fraud detection is made using an autoencoder followed by a logistic regression.
The results are compared to a pure logistic regression.

The autoencoder allows slightly higher results than the pure LR.
